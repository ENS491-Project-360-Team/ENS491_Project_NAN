## Project Description
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the most lethal cancers, with limited therapeutic options. Computational models trained on pharmacogenomic cell-line screens can help predict drug response and prioritize synergistic combinations.

In this project, we will try to design a computational framework for drug response and combination synergy prediction, explicitly comparing:

    Disease-specific models: trained only on pancreatic cancer cell lines.
    
    Pan-cancer models: trained on all cell-line data, then tested on pancreatic lines.
